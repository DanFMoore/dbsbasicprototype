          <p>Before getting a criminal record check you need to validate your identity. You can do this online for free using the government identity checking service, GOV.UK Verify.</p>

          <p>Verify allows you to prove who you are online by choosing from a list of companies that the government has approved to validate your identity.</p>

          <p>The company you choose will ask you for some personal details, so make sure youâ€™re somewhere you can easily access:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet" id="document-list">
              <li>your financial information, for example debit or credit cards, bank statements, loan information (or details of other financial contracts)</li>
              <li>your identity documents, for example a passport or driving licence</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We will use the name, date of birth and address provided by GOV.UK Verify in your application.</p>

                      <p>If you cannot validate your identity online with GOV.UK Verify, you can continue to apply online. You still need your financial and identity documents to hand.</p>

                      <p>But you'll also need to go to the Post Office in person after completing your application.</p>

                      <p>You'll have 14 days to take your identity documents to a Post Office that has a DBS ID validation service.</p>

                      <p>We will only start processing your application after you've been to the Post Office and validated your identity.</p>
